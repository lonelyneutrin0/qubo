Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Algorithms
This project explores many ways of optimizing a subset of quadric forms known as QUBO problems. Each method has its own merits and shortcomings. 
A QUBO problem is of the form \[f(\mathbf{v}) : \{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb R = \mathbf{v^T}\mathbf{A}_{nxn}\mathbf{v}\]
